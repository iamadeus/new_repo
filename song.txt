I'm coming home,
I've been gone for far too long,
Do you remember me at all?
I'm leaving,
Have I fucked things up again,
I'm dreaming,
Too much time without you spent
It hurts, wounds so sore,
Now I'm torn, now I'm sore,
I've been far away,
When I see your face my,
Hearts burst into fire,
Hearts burst into fire,
You're not alone,
I know I'm far from home,
Do you remember me at all?
I'm leaving,
Do you wait for me again?
I'm screaming,
No more days without you spent,
It hurts, wounds so sore,
Now I'm torn, now I'm sore,
I've been far away,
